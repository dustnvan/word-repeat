### About 
I always had a problem with repetitive word choice in my papers. To solve this, I made a program that can find duplicate words in the text and replace them with generated synonyms. It was a fun project that helped me dip my feet into asynchronous programming and SASS.

### Tools
- HTML
- Javascript
- Sass
- Fetch API
- Merriam-Webster's API
